## Decryption of a message using the Mteroplois-Hastings algorithm

This project is part of the subject 'Stochastic Processes' of the Statisctics degree.
The program, developed in R, is able to decrypt a message including characters of the spanish alphabet.
To achieve it I used some files containing information about the most frequent word lenghts, bigrams and trigrams in spanish.
It is based on the [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)
